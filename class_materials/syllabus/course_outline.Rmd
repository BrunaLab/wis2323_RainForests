<!-- ***Abridged Version in the UF Course Catalog:***  -->


<!-- This course investigates the fundamental issues addressed by scientists studying tropical rain forests, including what gave rise to their remarkable biodiversity, the drivers and consequences of deforestation, why people are fascinated by rain forests, cultural stereotypes about the tropics, and if forest conservation is compatible with socioeconomic development.   -->


<!-- ***Longer, More Exciting Version:***  -->

<!-- Tropical rain forests cover approximately 15% of the Earth’s land surface but contain over 50% of the world’s biodiversity. They are also the home to millions of people, the source of products central to our lives, shape global climate, and are being cleared at unprecedented rates. Students in this class will investigate the same fundamental questions asked by researchers studying rain forests:  -->

<!-- - Why are we fascinated by tropical rain forests? -->

<!-- - What gave rise to their remarkable biodiversity? -->

<!-- - How did 'jungle' stereotypes permeate everything from art to international relations? -->

<!-- - What are the national and international drivers and consequences of deforestation? -->

<!-- - Is forest conservation compatible with socioeconomic development? -->

<!-- Because these questions and their answers are inherently multidisciplinary, the course will include content from the humanities, social sciences, and biophysical sciences. While the course focuses on tropical countries, a central theme of the course is exploring the individual, local, national, and global impacts of tropical rain forests in an increasingly interconnected world. -->

<!-- # Course Overview   -->

<!-- \vspace{0.3cm} -->

This course investigates the fundamental issues addressed by scientists studying tropical rain forests, including what gave rise to their remarkable biodiversity, the drivers and consequences of deforestation, why people are fascinated by rain forests, cultural stereotypes about the tropics, and if forest conservation is compatible with socioeconomic development. ***By the end of the course students will be able to:***  

-   Recognize and describe stereotypes about rain forests & their residents
-   Analyze rain forest tropes in art, literature, & popular culture
-   Discuss & evaluate hypotheses for the origins and maintenance of tropical biodiversity
-   Explain & compare human history in rain forests
-   Review contemporary threats to rain forests
-   Analyze and visualize data on deforestation
-   Review and contrast strategies for rain forest conservation & restoration
-   Identify rain forests in their daily lives & set personal goals for advancing their conservation
-   Produce materials for communicating about rain forests to family and peers

# Assignments, Grades, & Participation
\vspace{0.3cm}
Learning in our class is achieved with an diverse array of methods ranging from data analysis to essays to projects. In most class sessions you will also be working with small groups of students to complete an in-class assignment that reinforces the major themes of the day's topic. In keeping with the philosophy of the Quest program, this course also has *Experiential Learning and Self-Reflection Components*. For details on the different types of assignments and the Quest Learning Components, see course Canvas page.

**In-class Assignments are due by the following class session.** Late assignments will lose 10 pts.
 
**_Regrades:_** Requests for re-evaluation of assignments must be accompanied by an explanation for why you think you deserve additional credit and the number of additional points you think you deserve. The deadline for submission is one week after the work was returned.

***Grade Assignment*** (based on % of total points earned): A = 94--100%, A- = 90--93%, B+ = 87--89%, B = 84--86%, B- = 80--83%, C+ = 77--79%, C = 74--76%, C- = 70--73%, D+ = 67--69%, D = 64--66%, D- = 60--63%, E<60

<!-- ## Attendance & Participation -->

<!-- \vspace{0.3cm} -->

***Attendance:*** Though attendance is not required, many of the sessions we will be completing activities in class that count towards your grade. Most of these can be completed independently, but by doing them in class you will benefit from working collaboratively with the other students. 

*Some of the in-class activities can not be completed outside of class time.* If you miss class on one one of these days, that is why the grade for in-class activities is based on a subset of the total activities; you can also elect to make up lost points with extra-credit assignments. *If you need to miss class for any reason, please let me know as soon as possible*. We will make arrangements for you to complete any assignments and go over any material you will be missing. I would much rather you focus on your health, attend your conference, or support friends and family in need than struggle to turn in assignments.

***Participation:*** Consistent informed, thoughtful, and considerate class participation is encouraged (and in some cases required). *If you have personal issues that prohibit you from joining freely in class discussion (e.g., shyness, language barriers, medical condition): no problem.* let us know and we will discuss alternative modes of participation.

***Important note regarding class discussions and group work:*** We will explore some challenging, important problems and increase our understandings of different perspectives and approaches for addressing them. These conversations may not always be easy; we sometimes will make mistakes in both how we communicate our perspective and what we hear other say. There may be times when we need patience, courage, imagination, and of course mutual respect to engage our texts, classmates, instructors, guests, and our own ideas and experiences. *Disrespectful or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated*. And always remember that as scholars we must employ critical thinking, rely on data, and cite verifiable sources and experts to interrogate all assigned readings and subject matter in this course as a means of determining if we agree with classmates and instructors. No lesson is intended to espouse, promote, advance, inculcate, or compel a particular feeling, perception, viewpoint or belief.
